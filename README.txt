Walking up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought
I saw your shadow running around
It's funny how things
never change in this old town
So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything From when we were the children playing in this fairground
